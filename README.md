# ATTransport

Working Proof of concept (Very hacky) for my work here : http://mindingdata.com/2016/02/14/visualizing-auckland-public-transport/

You will have to download the MAXX transit feed files from here : https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/more-services/google-transit-feed/. Place those files in the google_transit folder in the project, and make sure they are set to "Copy if newer".
